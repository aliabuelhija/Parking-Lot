The final project in course OOD (Object Orinted Desgin),the project helps users to find and report avilabile car parking in chosen streets in different regions  . 
# Description
Developed a parking lot system with a user interface, which helps users to find an available parking lot in an area of their choice.
Tools â€“ Java, OOP, Java Swing for GUI, MySQL DB.

In additon, we used 3 desgin patterns (Singleton,Facde and Factory).

1) Singleton: We used this desgin pattern in our project , because we wanted to create only one object(from access type ) 
2) Facde: We used Facde provides comfortable API for our different frames . it helps to work easier with the database . the Facde also allows to improve the code if we want to change or add  databases without the  entire code  . 
3) Factory: This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.
